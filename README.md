# Deep-Learning-w-Python

This repository is a personal walkthrough of the book "Deep Learning with Python" by Francois Chollet. The book as well as the code implementation on [this website](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python?a_aid=keras&a_bid=76564dff).

The book was written in 2017 when Tensorflow was still in its first version and Keras was not impelemented as part of TF. The code on this repository is updated with the latest code and is generated using Python 3.7 with Tensorflow 2.3.0.
